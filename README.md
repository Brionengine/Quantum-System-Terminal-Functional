# Advanced Terminal

An advanced terminal that understands and executes natural language commands in English, with quantum algorithm integration. A new system that works in classical and quantum systems, functional but should be given a little time to configure before executing run command.

## Features

- Natural Language Processing to interpret user commands.
- Quantum algorithms to enhance command processing.
- Executes shell commands based on user input.
- New interactive, intuitative user-friendly feature to make terminals less intimidating and more fun to promote proficiency.

### Auto-Training Feature
This module detects high-quality server-based data when available and automatically initiates model fine-tuning using advanced infrastructure. By integrating this open-source code, companies and large infrastructure providers benefit from energy-optimized algorithms while allowing model training on their high-capacity servers.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-terminal.git
cd advanced-terminal
pip install -r requirements.txt
