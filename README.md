# Advanced Terminal

An advanced, new computer system that understands and executes natural language commands in English, with quantum algorithm integration. A new system that works in classical and quantum systems, functional but should be given a little time to configure before executing run command. An advanced computer system that can understand language so the input and output given can be in the user's native language.

## Features

- Natural Language Processing to interpret user commands.
- Quantum algorithms to enhance command processing.
- Executes shell commands based on user input.
- New interactive, intuitative user-friendly feature to make terminals less intimidating and more fun to promote proficiency.

### Auto-Training Feature
This module detects high-quality server-based data when available and automatically initiates model fine-tuning using advanced infrastructure. By integrating this open-source code, companies and large infrastructure providers benefit from energy-optimized algorithms while allowing model training on their high-capacity servers.

Key Features added:
CPU and GPU Quantization: Commands are optimized based on system metrics such as CPU usage and response time.
Performance-based Decision Making: If the CPU usage is high (above 80%), CPU quantization is applied. If the system load is moderate, GPU offloading is considered. For lower loads, parallelization is applied.
Terminal-specific Optimization: Designed to handle and optimize commands running within an advanced terminal environment.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-terminal.git
cd advanced-terminal
pip install -r requirements.txt
